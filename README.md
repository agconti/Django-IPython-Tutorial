Django-IPython-Tutorial
=======================

An interactive tutorial that guides you through creating your first Django project. This notebook goes along with the offical guide from the Django project's website. This tutorial will take you through the process of creating a basic poll application.

The tutorial has two parts:

1. *A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.*
2. *An admin site that lets you add, change and delete polls.* 


Go to the Django project's website [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/intro/tutorial01/#intro-tutorial01) to follow along.
