      "\n",
      "The name of each `Field` instance (e.g. `question` or `pub_date` ) is the field\u2019s name, in machine-friendly format. You\u2019ll use this value in your Python code, and your database will use it as the column name.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use an optional first positional argument to a Field to designate a human-readable name. That\u2019s used in a couple of introspective parts of Django, and it doubles as documentation. If this field isn\u2019t provided, Django will use the machine-readable name. In this example, we\u2019ve only defined a human-readable name for `Poll.pub_date`. For all other fields in this model, the field\u2019s machine-readable name will suffice as its human-readable name.\n",
